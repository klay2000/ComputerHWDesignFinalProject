WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, fakelcd/clkgen/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: mclk 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'fakelcd/clkgen/mclk' is not directly connected to top level port. Synthesis is ignored for IBUF_LOW_PWR but preserved for implementation.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
